These C programs was written in Visual Studio Code. And the output was in CMD.
DevC++ can have some issues to run them because the loops variables were not created beafor loops.
instad of using the syntax :

int i;
for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
    /* code */
}
  
this was used :
       
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
    /* code */
}



The second one can displays errors in compilation. 
It's better to run them on the CMD or terminal to avoide compilation errors.
